# 16 bit simple CPU for FPGA with assembler

Simple 16 bit based CPU for education, with supporting assembler.

## Verilog Code
Verilog code to define a simple CPU, tested on BASYS 3.

## Assembler
Assember, writen in C, reading the opcode table from the verilog files, and parsing simple assembly language to produce executable code. Supports macros.
